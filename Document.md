## Introduction

This sample Node.js application demonstrates a basic setup with Express.js, MongoDB, and a simple REST API.

## Architecture

The architecture of the application is depicted in the following diagram:

```mermaid

    A[Client] --> B[Express Server];
    B --> C[Controller];
    C --> D[Service];
    D --> E[MongoDB];
```

## Workflow

The workflow of the application is illustrated in the sequence diagram below:

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Controller
    participant Service
    participant Database

    Client->>Server: HTTP Request
    Server->>Controller: Route Request
    Controller->>Service: Business Logic
    Service->>Database: Query/Update
    Database-->>Service: Response
    Service-->>Controller: Processed Data
    Controller-->>Server: Response
    Server-->>Client: HTTP Response
```
